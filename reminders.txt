"Starting With First Django Project" 
We have learned today that we can also do template inheritance,
although Django can be part of front end, but mostly used for backend development.
 1. {% block content %} {%endblock%} are used for template 
    inheritance, must be written in main file. It act as a wrapper tag. Eg. from 'room.html
    {% extends 'main.html' %}

    {% block content %}
    <h1>Room Template</h1>
    {% endblock %}
